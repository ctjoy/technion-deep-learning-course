**Your answer:**
 $\sigma^2$ is a hyperparameter which determines the relative importance between 
 data_loss and kl_divergence. Data loss is the difference between the reconstruction picture and
 the orginal data picture.  If the value is big, the importance of data_loss is 
 relatively small. The importance of data_loss mainly exist in decode. Therefore, the effect of
 decoder is more important. kl_divergence can be interpreted as the information gained by using 
 the posterior is more important than the prior distribution.  If it is small, the importance of 
 kl_divergence is relatively small.If this is kl_divergence is less important. It means 
 that the posterior plays less important role in the final loss and therefore the encoder is less
 important.
