    "In this assignment we'll create a from-scratch implementation of two fundemental deep learning concepts: the backpropagation algorithm and stochastic gradient descent-based optimizers.\n",
    "Following that we will focus on convolutional networks.\n",
    "We'll use PyTorch to create our own network architectures and train them using GPUs on the course servers, and we'll conduct architecture experiments to determine the the effects of different architectural decisions on the performance of deep networks."

    "- Please read the [getting started page](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236605/assignments/getting-started/) on the course website. It explains how to **setup, run and submit** the assignment.\n",
    "- Please read the [course servers usage guide](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236605/assignments/hpc-servers/). It explains how to use and run your code on the course servers to benefit from training with GPUs.\n",
